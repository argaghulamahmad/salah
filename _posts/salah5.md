### Putting it All Together  


In the previous chapter we covered how to perform a rakah – or one unit of
prayer.

We are now going to combine 2, 3, or 4 rakah together to perform the 5 daily
salah which are Fajr (dawn), Dhur (noon), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (evening),
and Isha (nightfall).



### The 5 Daily Salah



#### 1\. How to Pray Fajr – 2 Rakah

This is the first prayer of the day and it takes place at the time of dawn
before sunrise.

This prayer requires 2 rakah. For both rakah you will recite surah Fatihah
loudly and a second chapter from the Qur’an loudly as well.

Let’s watch this video to get a better idea.





#### 2\. How to Pray Dhur – 4 Rakah

You will pray _**silently** _for the entire prayer. However, the narrator here
says everything loudly so you can follow along.





#### 3\. How to Pray Asr – 4 Rakah

Similar to the Dhur prayer, you will perform Asr _**silently** _for the entire
prayer. However, the narrator in the video says everything loudly so you can
follow along.





#### 4\. How to Pray Maghrib – 3 Rakah  

You will recite loudly for the first 2 rakah, and then recite silently for the
3rd rakah.





#### 5\. How to Pray Isha – 4 Rakah

Similar to Maghrib which comes before it, you will recite loudly for the first
2 rakah, and then recite silently for the last 2 rakah.





#### Message for Employers

If you are an employer, manager, or supervisor who has Muslim staff, here are
a few important things for you to know:

  * If you have Muslim staff please provide a quiet room for them to pray in.
  * In a typical 9:00 – 5:00 PM shift, a Muslim will likely need to take 1 – 2 short breaks to pray.
  * The first break will come around 12 noon to around 2:00 PM so they can pray Dhur (the noon prayer).
  * And the second prayer they may also pray is Asr (the afternoon prayer). Depending on where you live in the world, this may take place between 2:00 – 6:00 PM.

Making these accomodations for your Muslim staff will be greatly appreciated.


That brings us to the end of this chapter. With some practice you will become
comfortable with the daily salah.

In the next chapter we’ll cover the conditions and pillars of the prayer that
must be fulfilled, otherwise our prayers will not be accepted by Allah.
