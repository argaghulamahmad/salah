### What is Salah?


The salah is a special form of worship that is the second most important
pillar of Islam after the shahada (testimony of faith). It is an obligatory
form of prayer performed five times a day that was revealed in the Holy Qur’an
and taught to us by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

There are many verses in the Holy Quran which Allah tells us about the
importance of prayer. Here are two such verses:

> But those who hold fast to the Book and establish prayer – indeed, We will
> not allow to be lost the reward of the pious.  
>  Qur'an - Chapter 7, Verse 170

> Recite, [O Muhammad], what has been revealed to you of the Book and
> establish prayer. Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing, and
> the remembrance of Allah is greater. And Allah knows that which you do.  
>  Qur'an - Chapter 29, Verse 45

The salah involves a number of physical movements – standing, bowing,
prostrating, and sitting. It also involves the recitation of verses from the
Holy Quran in Arabic along with a number of dua (supplications).

The Muslim will face the direction of the Kaba, the Sacred House of Allah in
Makkah, whenever they perform their prayer. These physical movements,
recitations, and supplications are all done to show humility and submission to
Allah.

### Why do Muslims Pray Salah?


The reason why Muslims pray at all relates to what Islam considers to be the
purpose of life – **to worship Allah alone.** Shortly after Muhammad became a
Prophet, the performance of salah (worship) was one of the first commandments
given to him by Allah.

Allah Almighty tells us in the Holy Qur’an that mankind was only created for
one reason: to worship Him.

> And I (Allah) created not the jinns and humans except they should worship Me
> (Alone).  
>  Qur'an - Chapter 51, Verse 56

The salah is the second pillar of Islam and it is a critical part of a
Muslim’s faith. One of the biggest differences between a Muslim and a non-
Muslim is the salah. Our beloved Prophet (peace be upon him) said:

_“Between a man and polytheism and disbelief there stands his neglect of the
prayer.”_

### Why Do Muslims Pray 5 Times a Day?


This question is quite common and many people do not know the real reason of
where the number five came from. When Muhammad (peace be upon him) became a
Prophet at the age of forty one of the first things he was taught was how to
pray. Allah sent the angel Gabriel (Jibreel) to teach him how to make wudu and
perform the salah.

Some 11 years after the beginning of prophethood a miraculous journey took
place in which the angel Gabriel took Muhammad (peace be upon him) to the
first heaven. It was during this event that Allah commanded him and the
Muslims to specifically pray five times a day. This event was recorded in the
Holy Qur’an and we also have authentic narrations from the Prophet (peace be
upon him) himself that he undertook this journey.

The full story of the Prophet’s ascent to heaven is known as _**Isra and
Mi’raj**_. It is a lengthy story for which we will not go into detail.
However, the last part of the story will be shared; the part where the
commandment to pray specifically five times a day was given. Up until that
point in history the Muslims would perform salah, but there was no specific
number of times that was legislated.

### The Story of Isra and Mi’raj



> Exalted is He who took His Servant (Prophet Muhammad) by night from al-
> Masjid al-Haram (In Makkah) to al-Masjid al- Aqsa (Jerusalem), whose
> surroundings We have blessed, to show him of Our signs. Indeed, He is the
> Hearing, the Seeing.Qur'an - Chapter 17, Verse 1




The last part of the Isra and Mi’raj story begins at the moment the angel
Gabriel (Jibreel) brings Muhammad (peace be upon him) from Makkah to
Jerusalem, and then to the gates of the first level of heaven:

_When I reached the nearest heaven. Gabriel said to the heaven gatekeeper,
‘Open the gate.’ The gatekeeper asked, ‘Who is it?’ He said, ‘Gabriel.’ The
gatekeeper asked,’ Who is accompanying you?’ Gabriel said, ‘Muhammad.’ The
gatekeeper said, ‘Has he been called?’ Gabriel said, ‘Yes.’ Then it was said,
‘He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!’ Then I met Adam and greeted
him and he said, ‘You are welcomed O son and Prophet.’_

_Then we ascended to the second heaven. It was asked, ‘Who is it?’ Gabriel
said, ‘Gabriel.’ It was said, ‘Who is with you?’ He said, ‘Muhammad.’ It was
asked, ‘Has he been sent for?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ It was said, ‘He is welcomed.
What a wonderful visit his is!” Then I met Isa (Jesus) and Yahya (John the
Baptist) who said, ‘You are welcomed, O brother and a Prophet.’_

_Then we ascended to the third heaven. It was asked, ‘Who is it?’ Gabriel
said, ‘Gabriel.’ It was asked, ‘Who is with you? Gabriel said, ‘Muhammad.’ It
was asked, ‘Has he been sent for?’ ‘Yes,’ said Gabriel. ‘He is welcomed. What
a wonderful visit his is!’ (The Prophet added:). There I met Joseph (Yusuf)
and greeted him, and he replied, ‘You are welcomed, O brother and a Prophet!’_

_Then we ascended to the 4th heaven and again the same questions and answers
were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met Idris and greeted him.
He said, ‘You are welcomed O brother and Prophet.’_

_Then we ascended to the 5th heaven and again the same questions and answers
were exchanged as in previous heavens. There I met and greeted Aaron (Harun)
who said, ‘You are welcomed O brother and a Prophet”._

_Then we ascended to the 6th heaven and again the same questions and answers
were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Moses
(Musa) who said, ‘You are welcomed O brother and a Prophet.’ When I proceeded
on, he started weeping and on being asked why he was weeping, he said, ‘O
Lord! Followers of this youth who was sent after me will enter Paradise in
greater number than my followers.’_

_Then we ascended to the seventh heaven and again the same questions and
answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met and greeted
Abraham who said, ‘You are welcomed O son and a Prophet.’_

_Then I was shown al-Bait al-Ma’mur (i.e. God’s House). I asked Gabriel about
it and he said, This is al-Bait al-Ma’mur where 70,000 angels perform prayers
daily and when they leave they never return to it (but always a new group
comes into it daily).’_

_Then I was shown Sidrat al-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I
saw its Nabk fruits which resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a town in
Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears of elephants, and four rivers
originated at its root, two of them were apparent and two were hidden. I asked
Gabriel about those rivers and he said, ‘The two hidden rivers are in
Paradise, and the apparent ones are the Nile and the Euphrates.’_

_**Then fifty prayers were enjoined on me**. I descended till I met Moses who
asked me, ‘What have you done?’ I said, ‘Fifty prayers have been enjoined on
me.’ He said, ‘I know the people better than you, because I had the hardest
experience to bring the Israelites to obedience. Your followers cannot put up
with such obligation. So, return to your Lord and ask Him (to reduce the
number of prayers).’ I returned and asked Allah (for reduction) and He made it
forty. I returned and (met Moses) and had a similar discussion, and then
returned again to Allah for reduction and He made it thirty, then twenty, then
ten, and then I came to Moses who repeated the same advice. _**_Ultimately
Allah reduced it to five_** _. When I came to Moses again, he said, ‘What have
you done?’ I said, ‘Allah has made it five only.’ He repeated the same advice
but I said that I surrendered (to God’s Final Order)'” God’s Apostle was
addressed by Allah, “I have decreed My Obligation and have reduced the burden
on My servants, and_ ** _I shall reward a single good deed as if it were ten
good deeds._**

— Sahih al-Bukhari, volume 4, Book 54, Hadith number 429



### Rewards and Benefits of Praying Salah

There are plenty of rewards and benefits to the prayer that were not listed in
the graphic.

It strengthens your faith and influences you to do more good deeds. It creates
strong bonds of unity among the Muslims, especially when the prayer is
performed as a congregation at a masjid. It also serves as an excellent relief
for stress and worry.

> Most surely, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find solace.Qur'an -
