## Chapter 4

### Getting Started

Now that our wudu has been properly made we can proceed and begin to pray
salah. Here are the steps of the salah:

  * Standing
  * Takbir
  * Fatihah – Recitation
  * Ruku – Bowing
  * Sujud – Prostration
  * Tashahud – Sitting

To understand the steps of the salah it is important to understand that the
prayer is made up of _rakah_ , or units of prayer. Every rakah has the same
basic steps within it.

  * There will be a part when you are standing
  * A part when you recite from the Quran
  * A part when you bow down
  * A part where you prostrate (make sujud)

Depending on which prayer you are performing there will be slight differences
in how these rakah are performed. Here is a summary of how each of the five
daily prayers differ from one another:

  * **Fajr** – has two rakah, or two units
  * **Dhur** – has four rakah
  * **Asr** – has four rakah
  * **Maghrib** – has three rakah
  * **Isha** – has four rakah

Let us break down how each rakah of the salah is performed, step by step.



### Learning How to Pray: One Rakah at a Time

If you would like to jump ahead to any of the 13 steps you can click on the
options below:









#### Step 1 – Make your intention to pray  

We first began the prayer by making an intention from the heart to pray to
Allah. As soon as you begin, your entire focus should be on the prayer itself
and nothing else.









#### Step 2 – Raise your hands to your ears and say ‘Allahu Akbar”  

The moment you say “Allahu Akbar” the prayer will officially begin. From this
point forward you should focus wholeheartedly on the prayer and do your best
to ignore all distractions.

**Fun Fact:** What do you think Allahu Akbar means? In most Arabic to English
translations it is defined as “Allah is the Greatest.” However, the real
meaning of the phrase is “Allah is Greater.” It means that Allah is greater
than everything in existence. In the moment of praying salah, saying Allahu
Akbar is a reminder to the Muslim that Allah is greater than all other
thoughts and actions.









#### Step 3 – Lower your hands and place them over your naval. Your right hand
should be placed over your left hand

#### Step 4 – Keep your eyes focused on the ground in front of you  

Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said that while you praying your eyes
should always look to where you will prostrate.

Although it is not obligatory, it is also highly recommended to read the
following dua (supplication) after saying Allahu Akbar:

_subhanakal-lahumma wabihamdika_  
_watabarakas-muka_  
_wataa ‘ala jadduka_  
_wala ilaha ghayruka._

_How perfect you are, O Allah. I praise you_  
_How blessed is Your name_  
_How lofty is Your position_  
_And none has the right to be worshipped but You_









#### Step 5 – Recite the opening chapter of the Qur’an  

The first chapter of the Qur’an is called Surah Fatihah. You will begin by
saying this Arabic phrase:

_A’auodu billaahi minash-shaytaanir rajeem_

‘I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Shaytan (devil).’

And then begin to recite the chapter verse by verse in Arabic:

_Bismillaahir ar-Rahmani ar-Raheem_  
_Al hamdu lillaahi rabbil ‘alameen_  
_Ar-Rahmani ar-Raheem_  
_Maaliki yawmid deen_  
_Iyyaaka na’aboodu wa iyyaaka nasta’een_  
_Ihdeenas siraatal mustaqeem_  
_Siraatal ladheena an ‘amta’ alayhim_  
_Ghayril maghduubi’ alayhim waladawleen_

This is the meaning of the verses from Surah Fatihah:

In the name of God, the infinitely Compassionate and Merciful.  
Praise be to Allah, Lord of all the worlds.  
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.  
Master on the Day of Recompense (Judgement Day).  
You alone do we worship, and You alone do we ask for help.  
Guide us on the straight path,  
The path of those who You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked
[Your] anger or of those who are astray.









#### Step 6 – Bow down. This is known as the _‘ruku’_  

As you are bowing down say ‘Allahu Akbar’. Make sure to keep your back
straight, your hands on your knees, and your eyes focused on the ground where
you will be prostrating.

![](/assets/blog/salah/how-to-make-ruku-bowing-down.jpg)

When you are in this position you will say this sentence three times:

_Subhanna rabbeeyal adheem_

‘How perfect is my Lord, the Magnificent’







#### Step 7 – Return to standing up again  

As you are rising up from the ruku position to a standing position you will
bring your hands to your ears and will say:

_Samee Allahu leeman hameeda_

‘Allah hears those who praise him’

And when you are standing upright then lower your hands to your waist and say:

_Rabbana walakal hamd_

‘Our Lord, to You is all praise’









#### Step 8 – Go down to perform prostration. This is known as _‘sujud’_  

As you are moving into this position say Allahu Akbar.

And also make sure your forehead, nose, palms of both hands, knees, and both
toes are touching the ground.

#### Step 9 – Say this phrase while in sujud (prostration)  

Say this sentence three times:

_Subhanna rabbeeyal ‘alaa_

How perfect is my Lord, the Most High









#### Step 10 – Rise up from sujud and sit for a moment

Say Allahu akbar as you rise from sujud and then sit on your left leg. Your
left foot will rest on the floor while your right foot is upright. Place your
hands on your knees.

When you are in this position it is recommended to ask Allah for forgiveness.
A simple and easy dua you can say is:

_Rabbigh-fir lee_

O my Lord, forgive me.

#### Step 11 – Return to the position of sujud

You will repeat step 9 again and perform a second sujud and say _subhanna
rabbeeyal ‘alaa_ three times again.

#### Step 12 – Arise from the sujud to return to the standing position and say
Allahu Akbar  

Congratulations, you have just completed one full rakah! The first rakah of
every prayer is performed with these twelve steps.

When you reach the end of the second rakah you will perform the _**tashahud**_
, or a step 13.









#### Step 13 – Perform the tashahud at the end of every two rakah  

Instead of standing up after the two sujud, this time around you will sit on
your legs and knees again. You will raise your right index finger and say:

_At Tahiyyaatu lilaahi was Salawaatu wat tayibaatu_  
_Assalaamu ‘alaika ayyuhan nabiyyu wa rahmatul laahi wa barakaatuh_  
_Assalaamu ‘alaynaa wa ‘alaa ‘ebaadillaahis saaliheen,_  
_Ash hadu allaa ilaah ilallaah Wa ash hadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhuu wa
rasuuluh_

All compliments, prayers and pure words are due to Allah.  
Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allaah and His blessings.  
Peace be upon us, and on the righteous slaves of Allaah.  
I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I
bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger


![](/assets/blog/salah/saying-tashahud-and-salah-an-nabi-prophet.jpg)
![](/assets/blog/salah/sitting-position-in-salah.jpg)

If this is the ** _final rakah_ in the prayer** then you will add this part to
the tashahud:

_Allaahumma salli ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala aali Muhammad_  
_Kamaa salayta ‘ala Ibraaheem wa ‘ala aali Ibrahim_  
_Innaka Hameedun Majeed_  
_Wa baarik ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala aali Muhammad_  
_Kamaa baarakta ‘ala Ibraaheem wa ‘ala aali Ibrahim_  
_Innaka Hameedun Majeed_

O Allaah, send prayers upon Muhammad and upon the family (or followers) of
Muhammad, Just as You sent prayers upon Ibrahim and the family (or followers)
of Ibrahim,  
Verily, you are full of Praise and Majesty.  
O Allaah, bless Muhammad and the family (or followers) of Muhammad as You
blessed Ibrahim and the family (or followers) of Ibraaheem,  
Verily, you are full of Praise and Majesty.

**The ‘tasleem’:** after reciting the second part of the tashahud, you will
say the “tasleem.”

The tasleem is to look to your right and say:

_Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatu Allah_

And then to look to the left and say it again:

_Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatu Allah_

![](/assets/blog/salah/end-the-salah-with-tasleem-2.jpg)

Upon saying the tasleem the prayer will have come to an end.
